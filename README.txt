Finance-Scraper
===============

finance.py

A python module to get financial data
from the web, courtesy of the Yahoo!
Finance API.

This module has been designed with
ease of use and performance in mind.
(Read: not factual accuracy). I have not
extensively tested the factual accuracy of
the data returned from this API. Please do
some unit tests to make sure my data isn't
rubbish. Bug reports very welcome.
